# How It Works
## Jarvis leverages the OpenAI API to generate context-aware responses based on user input. The application uses the following libraries for audio processing:

### gtts: Converts text to speech using Google's Text-to-Speech API
### pygame: Plays audio files with adjustable speed and volume
### speech_recognition: Transcribes audio input using Google's Speech Recognition API
